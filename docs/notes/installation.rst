Installation
============

You can install ``algovision`` from PyPI using:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install algovision

Alternatively, you can install it from source.
We recommend using following commands to create a ``virtualenv`` but it should also work with your preferred workflow.

.. code-block:: bash

    virtualenv -p python3 .env1
    . .env1/bin/activate
    pip install -e .
